This is a Data Challenge for a specific company. My first trip with Time Series. So it's a bit rough and basic. But I learned a lot.

While I didn't spend a lot of time to refine it, Becasue I failed the next step of job intervew. This is just some insights I get from the data.

Would appreciate any improvement suggestion and welcome to ask details about the challenge.
